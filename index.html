		<h2 class="artikel" id="artikel-1">Our lord and saviour, Hatsune Miku</h2>
		<h3 class="credit">Written by <span class="writer">Yamaha Corporation and the Music Technology Group</span>, On <span class="date">31 August 2007</span></h3>
		<p>Hatsune Miku was the first Vocaloid developed by Crypton Future Media after they handled the release of the Yamaha vocal <span>Meiko and Kaito.</span>Miku was intended to be the first of a series of Vocaloids called the "Character Vocal Series" (abbreviated "CV Series"), which included Kagamine Rin/Len and Megurine Luka. Each had a particular concept and vocal direction.</p>
	
        <p>Hatsune Miku (初音ミク), codenamed CV01, was the first Japanese VOCALOID to be both developed and distributed by Crypton Future Media, Inc.. She was initially released in August 2007 for the VOCALOID2 engine and was the first member of the Character Vocal Series. She was the seventh VOCALOID overall, as well as the second VOCALOID2 vocal released to be released for the engine. Her voice is provided by the Japanese voice actress Saki Fujita (藤田咲, Fujita Saki).

            There have since been numerous installments, such as additional voice libraries dubbed 'Append', as well as an upgrade for the VOCALOID3 engine, which contained an English vocal release. She received a VOCALOID4 update to her Japanese and English voicebanks in August 2016, as well as a Mandarin Chinese voicebank in September 2017.
            
            On August 31, 2019, Miku received her first voicebank outside of VOCALOID, that being Piapro Studio with her NT release. While Crypton is focusing on their own program, they are still in collaboration with YAMAHA and will continue to sell VOCALOID products in parallel to the Piapro Studio editions.
            
            On August 30 2024, a refined and retuned edition of Hatsune Miku's original VOCALOID4 (V4X) voicebank, titled Hatsune Miku SP, was released for the PIAPRO CHARACTERS SUPER PACK; a set of Japanese voicebanks developed for the Piapro Studio for V4X and VOCALOID4 engines. This release was noted to improve Miku's overall balance of tone and pronunciation. On August 1, 2024, it was also announced that Hatsune Miku would be receiving an update to the VOCALOID6 engine, dubbed 'Hatsune Miku V6 AI', in response to strong requests from creators, marking her return to VOCALOID. It is expected to release sometime in 2024.</p>
